# Restaurant Management Data Analysis Project

The Restaurant Management Data Analysis project leverages SQL for data extraction and Python for data processing and visualization to provide comprehensive insights into various aspects of a restaurant's operations. This project aims to help restaurant managers and stakeholders make informed decisions based on data-driven analysis.

## Objectives

- **Data Extraction:** Utilize SQL queries to extract meaningful data from a MySQL database, covering various facets of restaurant management.
- **Data Processing:** Employ Python, specifically the Pandas library, to process and organize the data retrieved from SQL queries.
- **Data Visualization:** Create clear and insightful visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to represent the data analysis results effectively.

## Key Analysis Areas

1. **Menu Item Ingredients Distribution:** Understand the variety and frequency of ingredients used in different menu items.
2. **Customer Loyalty Program Distribution:** Analyze the distribution of customers across different loyalty program tiers.
3. **Total Completed Order Price:** Calculate the total revenue generated from completed orders.
4. **Staff Work Schedule Distribution:** Examine the distribution of staff schedules to optimize workforce management.
5. **Maximum Staff Pay Rate:** Identify the highest pay rates among the staff to understand wage distribution.
6. **Most Ordered Menu Item:** Determine which menu items are most popular among customers.
7. **Customer Reservations:** Analyze customer reservation patterns and frequencies.
8. **Menu Items with Chicken:** Identify menu items that include chicken as an ingredient.
9. **Table with Most Reservations:** Determine which tables are most frequently reserved.
10. **Customer with Most Orders:** Identify customers who place the highest number of orders.
